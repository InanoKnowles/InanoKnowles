### About Me
I like to think that I am a quirky and creative person who loves manga, anime, kpop and video games. I love solving problems and for the longest time I thought that I was solving problems through helping people achieve their health and fitness goals. However, my ability to help people in this space was limited to what sales I could make, the amount people I could convert and if each individual stuck to their personalised programs. Though I loved seeing the positive changes in my clients a part of me felt unsatisfied - As if I wasn't being challenged enough.

After getting a taste of what kinds of problems could be solved through the use of technology. I realised I could help so many people even if it is just to make doing their daily tasks and collaboration easier. I want to work on projects that can help teams solve problems whilst they work on their own projects.

Once I started to learn more about programming I discovered how much fun I had. The enjoyment of learning and the thrill of getting stuck and the satisfaction of getting unstuck. Finally I have found a career path that satisfies my mind and gets me out of bed full of excitement - The perfect challenge! Especially since not every case is the same and I'd need to keep constantly learning.

As soon as I understood what I was looking for in a career. On a friend's recommendation - I signed up to General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. It was tough and I struggled but at the end I successfully passed and recieved a certificate of completion. :tada:
